# alfred-tailwind-spacings

Simple alfred workflow that let's you search for the closest tailwind value to a pixle value.

# Goal

Tailwind uses custom values as described [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing).

The goal of this workflow is to make those values easier to find.

# Todos

[ ] Add documentation

[ ] Add better display of values (not only exact value but also values next to it)

[ ] Publish through npm -> see [alfy documentation](https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy#publish-to-npm)
